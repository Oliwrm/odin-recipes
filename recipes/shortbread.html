<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Make these moreish shortbread biscuits using just three ingredients. They're wonderfully crumbly and go perfectly with a cup of tea for a mid-morning treat</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>100g butter, chilled and cubed</li>
  <li>50g caster sugar</li>
  <li>150g flour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Heat the oven 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Put the flour, butter and sugar into a mixing bowl. Use your hands to combine the ingredients until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then squeeze until it comes together as a dough.</li>
  <li>On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to Â½ cm thick. Cut the dough into fingers and place on a lined baking tray. Use a fork to create imprints, then sprinkle with the remaining caster sugar.</li>
  <li>Chill the dough in the fridge for 20 mins, then bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown. Remove the shortbread fingers from the oven and leave to cool on the tray for 10 mins.</li>
