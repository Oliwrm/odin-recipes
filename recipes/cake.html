<p class="Description">This vanilla cake recipe is so easy to make, feel free to go big on the decoration. A simple dusting of icing sugar or edible flowers are our go-to option</p>
<h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li>175g butter, softened</li>
  <li>175g caster sugar</li>
  <li>3 large eggs</li>
  <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
  <li>175g flour</li>
  <li>1tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Heat the oven to 180Â°C (gas mark 4). Lightly grease an 18cm (7in) round cake tin with a little extra butter or margarine and cut a piece of greaseproof paper or non-stick baking parchment to fit the base of the tin.</li>
  <li>Put all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer for 1 minute, or until just combined. It's important not to beat the batter too much - just long enough to make it smooth.</li>
  <li>Pour or spoon the mixture into the tin, smooth the top and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for about 45-50 minutes. The cake is cooked when it looks well risen and golden; the top should spring back when lightly touched with a fingertip. Another test is to insert a skewer into the centre of the cake - it should come out clean.</li>
  <li>Let the cake sit in the tin for 5 minutes, then gently run a knife around the edge and turn it out onto a wire rack to cool. Serve dusted with icing sugar.</li>
</ol>
